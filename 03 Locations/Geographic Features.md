# San Magdalena Coast

The coastline of San Magdalena is marked by jagged cliffs, hidden coves, and unusually strong maritime currents. Local fishermen maintain generational knowledge of “bad water” zones - areas of the sea avoided despite abundant marine life. Official maritime charts note nothing irregular, though Coast Guard sonar readings frequently register deep, mobile anomalies beneath the waves. The historic bridge connecting the two islands exhibits operational interruptions during certain lunar phases, officially attributed to routine maintenance. Practitioners understand these patterns differently, though such interpretations are not found in public records.
# Kabigat Forest Reserve

The Kabigat Forest Reserve, occupying a significant portion of San Magdalena’s northern island, is a protected ecological zone known for its endemic flora found nowhere else, rare wildlife, and unexplained environmental anomalies. Officially managed by the **Cortez Corporation**, the reserve hosts multiple research stations, though access remains restricted to authorized personnel and regulated tours. The forest’s air is notably still, with frequent signal interruptions occurring for the SMRT's forest railway line, a phenomenon Cortez attributes to geomagnetic fluctuations. Independent studies have failed to confirm this explanation.

Local folklore surrounding the reserve speaks of **[[O - La Savia]]**, an entity said to inhabit the forest’s depths, though such accounts are officially dismissed as hallucinations induced by native fungi. Unusual tree growth patterns, inconsistent with known ecological cycles, remain unexplained, with certain areas of the forest quietly avoided even by veteran research teams. Despite the reserve’s scientific importance, the atmosphere suggests a place not merely preserved - but watched.
## Kabigat Lake

Kabigat Lake lies deeper within the forest reserve and is strictly off-limits to both tourists and researchers. Fishing has been prohibited for decades, officially due to environmental preservation efforts, though unofficial accounts describe unexplained animal disappearances and temperature shifts that do not align with surface weather patterns. The rumored underwater connection to Dalisay Lake remains unconfirmed, with sonar readings frequently disrupted by unexplained interference. Even Cortez Corporation personnel, who maintain the lake’s perimeter, are known to avoid lingering near its banks after nightfall.
# Dalisay Lake

Dalisay Lake, situated at the edge of Kabigat Forest Reserve, is a regulated tourist destination known for its remarkable water clarity and scenic beauty. The lake’s seasonal water level changes and unexplained temperature fluctuations are officially attributed to subterranean springs, though hydrological surveys have yet to locate them. Local guides often reference an unseen connection between Dalisay and Kabigat Lake, rumored to exist through a network of submerged caves. Maintenance staff operate under strict scheduling protocols, avoiding work near the waterline at dusk, though no formal reason is given.
# Mount Oriol

Mount Oriol dominates the northern island’s landscape, its dense forested slopes giving way to a restricted cave system that remains the subject of both geological and historical interest. While surface-level caverns appear natural, deeper sections transition into artificial tunnels of pre-colonial origin, though no official record identifies who constructed them or why. During the Japanese occupation, military operations were reportedly hindered by "unusual phenomena," and post-war, the mountain was sealed - officially for safety reasons. Researchers with access to the site follow strict procedural guidelines, though none seem to prevent the occasional reports of pathways that shift or chambers that should not exist.
