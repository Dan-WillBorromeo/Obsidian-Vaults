A coastal barangay known for its ancestral homes and deep traditional practices, Sukab experiences localized weather anomalies, often unexplained by meteorological data. Fishermen here have, on occasion, brought up objects from the sea that are quietly confiscated, with no public record of their existence. The Coast Guardâ€™s refusal to patrol these waters at night is officially a matter of maritime safety, though no such regulation appears in national directives.
