Tiburon is home to the aquatic park and its adjacent commercial complex. Local folklore suggests the “Sirena Spectacular” is more than a simple performance, with visitors reporting unexplainable sorrow while watching the show. Sonar readings in Tiburon Bay frequently return interference patterns with no environmental cause, though these anomalies are quietly removed from official maritime reports. It is an open secret among the Practitioners that a sirena is bound in service to the park.
Beneath its waters are tunnels that remain largely unexplored, though some researchers suspect they may connect to the larger underground network beneath the islands.
