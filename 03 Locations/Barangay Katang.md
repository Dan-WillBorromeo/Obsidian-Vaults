Known for its cultural institutions, Katang is home to the Museum of Local History, the city library, and a revitalized entertainment district. The Childrenâ€™s Memorial Park contains preserved pre-war play structures, with maintenance protocols that are unusually specific, though no formal reason is provided. Certain archived records in the museum and library remain behind locked access restrictions, with no indication of when - or why - those restrictions were enacted.
