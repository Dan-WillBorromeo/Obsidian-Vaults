# San Magdalena University

**San Magdalena University** is the island's premier academic institution, specializing in **botany**, **entomology**, and **anthropology**. Officially, these programs focus on **regional ecology and cultural preservation**. Those in the know, however, understand that SMU is more than a university - it is a hunting ground. The **Practitioner Families and Covens** that still linger in the city use it to **identify, test, and recruit** potential apprentices to continue their dwindling lineages and craft.

It is their **last stronghold**. They meet regularly, disguised as **book club gatherings**, where they **trade secrets, reinforce alliances, and quietly plot their return to power**. Some students who "drop out" of the official curriculum do not truly leave - instead, they **step into the hidden world**, marrying into Practitioner families and learning what the university does not officially teach.

Beneath the campus lies an **extensive tunnel network**, parts of which have been **co-opted by the [[B. Economy & Transport System#Transportation overview|SMRT railway]]**. Some tunnels are sealed year-round, only opening during certain festivals, while others lead to places unrecorded in university archives. Outside the established rail lines and mapped routes, the tunnels **shift unpredictably**, their passages rarely the same twice.

Long-term staff whisper of doors that should not exist, of halls that move when no one is looking, and of paths that do not always lead back.
# Tiburon Aquatic Park

Built over the remnants of an old fishing village, Tiburon Aquatic Park is a popular tourist destination, celebrated for its marine exhibits and the “Sirena Spectacular” show. However, since its opening in 1985, the park has been linked to persistent reports of unexplained grief or unease experienced by visitors during performances. Staff turnover remains significantly higher than industry averages, with exit interviews often citing vague but disturbing experiences. Security logs, restricted from public access, contain references to acoustic anomalies and unmapped trenches beneath the park’s waters - anomalies that, officially, do not exist.

It is unknown why the sirena living near it seemingly aid the park, as it is neither owned nor managed by Practitioners. Attempts to communicate with them have been unsuccessful thus far.
# Underground Tunnel Network

Beneath San Magdalena lies an expansive network of tunnels, constructed long before colonial records began. The system extends across both islands, with sections beneath the university, Mount Oriol, and Barangay Lambat still in use for maintenance - or, unofficially, for purposes no longer documented. Many corridors remain unmapped or sealed, with shifts in the tunnel layout reported as recently as 2007. Local authorities cite structural concerns, though persistent rumors suggest the tunnels connect to places that exist only in fragmented historical accounts, or not at all.
