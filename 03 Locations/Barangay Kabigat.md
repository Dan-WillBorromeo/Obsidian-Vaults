The largest barangay in the northern island, hugging its entire west coast. It houses both the **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Forest Reserve|Kabigat Forest Reserve]]**, **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Lake|Kabigat Lake]]**, and **[[Geographic Features#Dalisay Lake|Dalisay Lake]]**. Additionally, most of **Cortez Corporation**'s research stations are situated here. There are very few residential zones, and they primarily house **CorCorp** and conservation staff members. Local rumors abound of voices in the trees, officially explained as auditory hallucinations.

Out of the seven barangays, Kabigat is the only one to not have its own public school system. Instead, its denizens send their children to either **[[Barangay Tiwarik]]** or **[[Barangay Sukab]]**, whichever is closest.
## Kabigat Adventure Park

A supervised eco-tourism zone situated at the outer edges of the **Kabigat Forest Reserve** and operating under **CorCorp** oversight. Faculty maintenance follows specialized protocols regarding boundary maintenance.
### Kabigat Gift Shop

## Dalisay Lake Recreation Complex
