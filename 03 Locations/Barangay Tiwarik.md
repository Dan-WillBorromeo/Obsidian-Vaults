Tiwarik is a mix of residential land and untouched wilderness, with Mount Oriolâ€™s cave system forming its western boundary. A popular waterfall, believed to bless newlyweds, is accompanied by warnings against staying past sunset. The caves themselves are officially restricted, though local guides speak of pathways that shift and sections that transition from natural caverns into constructed tunnels of precolonial origin.
