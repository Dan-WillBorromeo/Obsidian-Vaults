> [!info] **There is *nothing* of note about Barangay Lambat.**

Barangay Lambat houses [[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]] and, by extension, the subterranean tunnel network that extends beyond the campus. Officially, the tunnels are for maintenance and research infrastructure, though some corridors lead to sealed chambers with no recorded construction history. Long-term residents quietly avoid discussing the tunnels, particularly when asked about the sections that should not, by any logic, exist.
### Schools
- **San Magdalena University Daycare** provides childcare services prioritizing university staff dependents
- **Lambat Elementary School** operates specialized arts programs funded through university grants
- **Lambat National High School**'s extensive tunnel network connects to the university's tunnel system, though several passages remain sealed
