Kannoyan serves as San Magdalenaâ€™s primary transit hub, housing the central rail and the main ferry. Public transportation markings, officially described as heritage decorations, resemble traditional protective symbols. An unregistered night market occasionally appears under certain lunar phases, though municipal authorities deny its existence. Transit staff working night shifts require cultural sensitivity certification, a requirement unique to this barangay.
