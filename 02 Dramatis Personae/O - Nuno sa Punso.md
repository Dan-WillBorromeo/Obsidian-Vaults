#Other, #Spirits 

Small, size-changing creatures that live within mounds of dirt and are very vindictive. They live and travel with others of their kind, and demand respect and deferment. When offended, they are maliciously vindictive. They harm in the way they are harmed, and aid in the way they are aided.  They are primarily allied with [[P - Tala Buenavides|Tala Buenavides]].

>  - **Amang Lunti:** A quiet observer that rarely speaks - but when he does, he imparts wisdom that changes those who hear it. It is better to not hear what he says, as his words hurt just as much as they aid.
