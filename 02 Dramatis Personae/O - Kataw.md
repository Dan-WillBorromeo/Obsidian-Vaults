> - **Dalik Mata**: Known to have once held good relationships with the (now gone) practitioner families there. Nowadays, she rests on the shore spreading warnings drowning in half-truths and vague riddles - at the cost of the asker's Self. She often appears as a watery woman from the torso upwards, every inch covered by unblinking, slit eyes, and her lower half is comprised of several oarfish.
> - **Tapat Alon**: Rarely takes visceral form and resides near the **[[Manmade Areas#Tiburon Aquatic Park|Tiburon Aquatic Park]]**. They aid it, for reasons unknown, and do not like speaking directly to humans. Tapat Alon is the cause of both the singing park staff hear at night, and  the grief felt by visiting parents.
