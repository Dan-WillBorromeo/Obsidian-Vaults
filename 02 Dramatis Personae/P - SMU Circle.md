#NPC , #Practitioner , #OldBlood, #Rapacious, #Argumentative

Once powerful, now dwindling, the **Balani**, **Mangubat**, and **Galang** families seek to reclaim their influence through the Centennial Ritual. They hold sway over the **[[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]]**, a seat of power they desperately cling to. Casting aside old grudges in the face of their children leaving for Manila, they've since made dozens of *aware* individuals out of their students. They host frequent, weekly meetings disguised as book clubs. Their sphere of influence extends no further than the whole of [[Barangay Lambat]].

> [!info] **Their Goals:**
> ---
> - Find heirs: New blood must be claimed, by recruitment, manipulation, or force.
> - Regain power: They are tired of being relics. The supernatural world still respects them - but for how much longer?
> - Prepare for the Centennial Ritual: If it fails, it wonâ€™t just be their names that disappear.

> [!example] **Members:**
> ---
> - **Ligaya Balani**: A *babaylan* - someone who curries favor from the spirits and gods. She is approachable, genuine in a way many in her situation won't be, but desperate to regain her family's status and favor with the spirits. She is the *Dean of Anthropology*.
> - **Bayani Mangubat:** A *sigbinan* - someone who cultivates and trains sigbin (rapacious, dog-like creatures that can harm people through their shadow). He is a sourly old man of a few words, whose love for his dwindling creatures far outweigh his love for his children. He is the *Dean of Zoology*.
> - **Dani Galang:** A *mambabarang* - someone who works with curses via insects and sympathetic magic. They are pragmatic, focused primarily on restoring their family and strengthening their position. They are the *Dean of Entomology*.
