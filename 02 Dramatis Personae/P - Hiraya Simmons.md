An unwilling priestess of a fading god of the hunt. She's a fugitive and thief that fled Manila after stealing a powerful relic. Where she walks, prey flees, predators sharpen their teeth, and violence erupts. She is unable to enjoy the comforts of modern life, a limitation enforced by her deity. Hiraya has been taken in by Cortez and is publicly recorded as an *independent consultant*. She's happy to be treated like a human again.

She is unable to eat what she doesn't hunt or gather herself, but can display traits of what she ate or call upon simulacra of them via their bones. She works with [[P - Emiliana M. Cortez|Emiliana]] at [[Barangay Kabigat]], but does not know the latter's relationship with [[O - La Savia|La Savia]].
