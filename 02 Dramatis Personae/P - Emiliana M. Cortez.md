#NPC, #Practitioner, #NewBlood

**Cortez Corporation**’s CEO, a beloved scientist, and **[[O - La Savia|La Savia]]**’s secret apprentice. On paper, she is a philanthropist and conservationist, funding research and infrastructure across San Magdalena.  She does not wield raw power. She cultivates it, refines it like a botanist shaping new species. Spirits are bound into vines, curses bloom like flowers, and memory-stealing roots drink deep from the dead. Where others burn and break, Emiliana alters, unbinds, and remakes.

She resides in [[Barangay Kabigat]], and is explicitly allied with [[P - Hiraya Simmons|Hiraya Simmons]] - sheltering the younger woman and providing her with kindness. Emiliana's primary goal is regaining youth, with helping her patron a secondary.
