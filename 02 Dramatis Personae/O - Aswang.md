#NPC, #Other, #Rapacious 

Predatory beings who live among humans. In the mornings, they appear as normal people - albeit when looked in the eye, your reflection would be upside down. They are nominal allies of the **[[P - SMU Circle|Mangubat]]** family. Most are flesh-eating, some in the literal sense and others in the metaphorical sense.

> - **Mateo Ilagan**: A funeral home director in his guise. While he is outwardly kind and helpful, he has an unsettling aura about him that few people can explain away. He feeds carefully from each corpse so as not to be noticed.
> - **Sabrina Lacsama**: A *mandurugo* viewed as a gold-digger in her guise, as she often attaches herself to the rich and wealthy of the city. She takes only what is willingly given, or what would have been lost anyway.
> - **Carmen Vega** (Viscera-Sucker): A *manananggal* who splits in two at night; one hunts while the other remains to keep up her guise. Out of all the aswang in San Magdalena, she is the most deceptive. 
> - **Antonio Dagohoy:** An auto-shop owner in his guise. He's friendly to most, but somehow always seems to know if you've left something (or someone) behind that you regret.
