# Introduction
San Magdalena is an island city divided in more ways than one. Officially, it is known for its vibrant festivals, conservation research, and maritime economy. Unofficially, it is a city of fractures -between history and modernity, Innocents and Others, the seen and the hidden.

Beneath its bright facade lies a reality that most will never perceive. Others - beings of myth and folklore - walk unseen among the city’s residents, their existence veiled by a quiet, persistent masquerade. Alongside them, Practitioners - *awakened* humans with the ability to do magic - struggle to maintain what little influence remains.

At the heart of San Magdalena’s hidden world is the Centennial Ritual - a tradition as old as the island itself, performed once every hundred years to ensure that something vast and ancient remains asleep beneath the city. Its purpose is known to few. Its failures, however, have reshaped history.

The ritual is set to take place again in 2011. No elder Practitioners remain to guide it. No written records exist to explain past failures. And yet, the signs have begun: tunnels shifting beneath the university, fishermen hauling up things better left below, a stillness settling over Kabigat Forest that does not belong.
# The Centennial Ritual

The Centennial Ritual has withstood the test of time. Though official records only trace it back to the 16th century, both Practitioners and Others know it has been performed for at least four centuries prior. While Spanish colonization forced it to adopt a Catholic veneer, its core structure remains unchanged.

> [!info] **It is conducted over three days:**
> ---
> 1. **The First Day:** At dawn, a procession of idols begins, each one carried through the city before being left behind in a designated barangay. By dusk, all idols must be in place.
> 2. **The Second Day:** A sacrifice is made at Mount Oriol. Blood or spirit, either given willingly or unknowingly - what is offered matters less than the act itself. In some accounts, a metaphorical sacrifice is enough.
> 3. **The Third Day:** The waters and forests are blessed. Practitioners recite precise words over the surface of lakes and soil, binding what must remain bound.

Its purpose is singular: to keep **[[O - The Sleeping Deep|something]]** asleep beneath the city. Its nature is uncertain. Oral traditions describe it as a writhing mass of coral-like structures, but accounts vary. The only certainty is its influence - each failure has coincided with a violent reshaping of San Magdalena’s fate.

> [!info] **The two failures**
> ---
> 16th Century: First failure aligns with Spanish colonization, erasing much of the island’s native Practices.
> 20th Century: Second failure coincides with Japanese occupation, shifting wealth and power irreversibly to the north.
>> [!warning]- **Signs of a third failure have already begun**
>> ---
>> - The tunnels beneath San Magdalena shift, leading to places that should not exist.
>> -  Fishermen have begun pulling up things from the sea - things that should have stayed buried.
>> -  The air in Kabigat Forest is too still, too sharp, as if the trees themselves are listening.

If the ritual fails again, the consequences may well be worse than war. The Practitioners of San Magdalena have little time. They must uncover what went wrong - before the next ritual begins. Before it wakes.
# The City of San Magdalena

San Magdalena is a coastal island city, divided in both geography and identity. The southern island is a dense, urbanized center of commerce, tourism, and academia, while the northern island remains affluent yet secluded, its forests and lakes untouched by modernization. A single railway bridge - the last of many that once connected the two islands - now serves as the city’s only link.

Though historically a fishing hub, its economy has shifted toward tourism, research, and trade. Yet beneath its modern veneer, San Magdalena harbors a deeper, hidden world. Others live unseen among the Innocents, their existence known only to a few. Practitioners struggle to maintain what little influence remains.
## City Structure

San Magdalena is divided into seven barangays, each shaped by history, geography, and supernatural influence.

### Southern Island
 The southern island is the city’s commercial and academic heart, home to **[[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]]**, the port, and the **[[Manmade Areas#Tiburon Aquatic Park|Tiburon Aquatic Park]]**. It is dense, modern, and always in motion.
 
 > [!info] **Barangay List**
 > ---
> - **[[Barangay Kannoyan]]:** The transit hub, housing the central rail station and ferry terminal. At night, an unregistered market appears under certain lunar phases, trading in things not meant for Innocent hands.
> - **[[Barangay Katang]]:** The city’s cultural district, home to the Museum of Local History, the city library, and a revitalized entertainment sector. Certain archived records remain sealed, their access restricted for reasons long forgotten.
> - **[[Barangay Lambat]]:**
>> [!error]- **There is nothing of note about Barangay Lambat**
>> The university district, built atop a vast underground tunnel network. Officially, the tunnels are for maintenance and research infrastructure. Unofficially, some corridors lead to places that should not exist.
> - **[[Barangay Tiburon]]:** The city’s tourism epicenter, home to the Tiburon Aquatic Park and its adjacent commercial complex. Sonar readings in Tiburon Bay frequently return interference patterns with no environmental cause. It is an open secret among Practitioners that a kataw is bound in service to the park.
### Northern Island
The northern island is home to San Magdalena’s wealthiest residents, as well as its most protected lands. Conservation zones and research facilities dominate its landscape, concealing deeper, older mysteries.

 > [!info] **Barangay List**
 > ---
 > - **[[Barangay Kabigat]]:** The largest barangay on the northern island, housing the **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Forest Reserve|Kabigat Forest Reserve]]** and multiple Cortez Corporation research stations. Locals speak of voices in the trees, dismissed as auditory hallucinations.
 > - **[[Barangay Sukab]]:** A coastal barangay with deep ancestral ties. Weather anomalies occur here frequently, unexplained by meteorological data. Fishermen occasionally haul up artifacts from the sea, only for them to be quietly confiscated. The Coast Guard refuses to patrol these waters at night.
 > - **[[Barangay Tiwarik]]:** A barangay of contrasts, where residential land meets untouched wilderness. **[[Geographic Features#Mount Oriol|Mount Oriol]]** looms over its western boundary, its caves officially restricted. Local guides tell of pathways that shift, leading deeper than they should.
 
# Timeline
## Pre-Colonial Era (Prior to 1565)
The origins of the **centennial ritual** trace back beyond recorded history. Oral accounts suggest it was established long before the arrival of colonial forces, though its original form remains speculative. The first known tunnel networks beneath the island were constructed during this period, with no surviving documentation of their intended purpose. Indigenous settlements thrived on both islands, establishing trade routes and maritime practices that persist in altered forms today. This era also marks the first recorded manifestations of **[[O - La Savia|La Savia]]**, though under a different name.
## Spanish Colonial Period (1565-1898)
Colonization reshaped San Magdalena, introducing new infrastructure and religious influence while eroding native Practices.

- **1565**: First Spanish settlement established.
- **1647**: Original inter-island bridges constructed.
- **1672**: First official documentation of **La Savia** incidents, though dismissed as native superstition.
- **1754**: Establishment of the first Catholic mission, precursor to **[[Barangay Sukab#Schools|St. Magdalena Catholic School]]**. La Savia entity given name by Spanish Practitioners living in [[Barangay Kabigat]].
- **1887**: First organized fishing guilds formed, implementing protocols that closely resemble pre-colonial maritime offerings.
## American Colonial Period (1898-1946)
Modernization efforts accelerated during this period, though unexplained anomalies continued to be recorded.

- **1901**: Establishment of the **public education system**. Modern barangay system established.
- **1912**: Foundation of **[[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]]**. 
- **1925**: First recorded research expedition into the **[[Geographic Features#Mount Oriol|Mount Oriol]] cave system**.
- **1932**: **Mysterious destruction of the original inter-island bridges**. The cause was never determined, though early reports reference **unusual environmental disturbances**.
- **1935**: Construction of the **current bridge**. Initial construction of **[[Barangay Katang|Kagitingan Military Base]]**.
- **1941**: Documentation of **unusual phenomena** during military operations. Reports classified.
## Japanese Occupation and Post-War Era (1942-1960)
The war disrupted the island’s established power structures, triggering shifts in wealth and influence.

- **1942**: **Japanese occupation begins**, forcing northern wealth migration southward.

- **1958**: **Cortez Corporation** regional office founded.
## Modern Development (1961-Present)
San Magdalena entered a new era of regulated expansion, though **traditional safeguards quietly remained in place**.

- **1961**: **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Forest Reserve|Kabigat Forest Reserve]]** protection protocols enacted.
- **1975**: Specialized **transit authority procedures** implemented; certain ferry routes and rail operations require unspecified “cultural clearances.”
- **1985**: Opening of **[[Manmade Areas#Tiburon Aquatic Park|Tiburon Aquatic Park]]**, coinciding with **documented marine behavioral anomalies**.
- **1992**: Establishment of **current educational zoning system**; multiple university records sealed without explanation.
- **2005**: Traditional **ritual practices integrated into municipal infrastructure protocols** under the guise of cultural preservation.
- **2007**: First recorded **tunnel shifts beneath San Magdalena University**; officially attributed to **soil movement**, though patterns suggest otherwise.
- **2011**: The **centennial ritual approaches**; unexplained phenomena escalate across the island.
