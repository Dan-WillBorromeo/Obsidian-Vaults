# Economy overview

San Magdalena’s economy is shaped by its unique geography, history, and supernatural undercurrents. Though tourism and conservation research are its most visible industries, the island’s financial landscape is influenced by deeper, often unseen forces.
## **Commerce & Trade**

San Magdalena’s **port** is the economic backbone of the **southern island**. While it handles standard commercial shipments, local businesses and transport companies have adapted to its unusual scheduling patterns, which align with celestial and tidal cycles. Some shipments arrive or depart only under specific lunar phases, and certain docks remain reserved for clients with undisclosed cargo.

- **Unregistered Trade**: A portion of the port’s economy exists outside formal oversight. Cargo manifests sometimes omit key details, and local dockworkers tell stories of containers that shift weight unpredictably or emit faint whispers.
- **Market Dynamics**: The port contributes to a thriving import-export sector, with San Magdalena acting as a distribution hub for goods moving between mainland Luzon and the Visayas.

## **Tourism & Entertainment**

San Magdalena’s festivals, natural attractions, and entertainment venues attract thousands of visitors annually. While tourism is a major economic driver, certain attractions operate under rules that differ from conventional business models.

- **[[Manmade Areas#Tiburon Aquatic Park|Tiburon Aquatic Park]]**: The park generates revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, and exclusive private viewings. It is rumored that special after-hours events cater to select clientele with distinct, often unspoken interests.
- **Eco-Tourism & Adventure Travel**: The **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Forest Reserve|Kabigat Forest Reserve]]** and **[[Barangay Kabigat#Dalisay Lake Recreation Complex|Dalisay Lake Recreation Complex]]** offer guided tours with limited access to select areas. Specialized permits are required for deeper explorations, particularly in locations associated with local myths.
- **The Unregistered Night Market**: Though its existence is officially denied, those who seek it can find rare and valuable artifacts, both mundane and arcane. Currency here does not always take the form of pesos.
## **Research & Conservation**

The northern island’s economy is heavily influenced by **conservation research**, primarily overseen by the **Cortez Corporation**.

- **Cortez Corporation’s Research Facilities**: High-security botanical and pharmaceutical labs conduct studies on endemic flora and marine life. Some of these studies have unexplained classifications, and research notes occasionally reference ancient purification rites.
- **University-Backed Studies**: **[[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]]** provides significant funding for ecological research, particularly in collaboration with foreign institutions. Certain research grants require faculty members to sign extensive non-disclosure agreements.
## **Real Estate & Land Development**

Property values vary drastically across the island, often in ways that defy conventional market forces.

- **Southern Island Congestion**: The commercial hub is highly developed, leading to inflated property values. However, urban planners report abandoned buildings where new tenants refuse to settle, despite prime locations.  
- **Northern Island Stability**: Despite limited infrastructure, properties in **[[Barangay Sukab]]** maintain steady value. Buyers are often long-term investors with generational ties to the land.
- **Restricted Lands**: Some plots are listed for sale but remain unsold for decades. Locals warn against disturbing such sites, though no official records explain why.
## **Maritime Economy & Fishing Anomalies**

San Magdalena’s fishing industry has dwindled, but maritime activities remain significant.

- **Selective Fishing Zones**: Certain areas, though teeming with marine life, are deliberately avoided by local fishermen. The waters near **Barangay Sukab** are particularly noted for their fluctuating conditions.
- **Private Maritime Operations**: Wealthy individuals and research groups fund independent expeditions, often with classified objectives.
# Transportation overview

San Magdalena has two primary modes of transportation. For those who can afford it, they take cars and use the ferry to get from one island to another. For everyone else, they use the **San Magdalena Rail Transit** (SMRT), a subsidiary of the **Cortez Corporation**.  Even though a private corporation, its CEO **Emiliana M. Cortez** ensures that prices remain affordable and that the trains arrive on schedule. The SMRT consists of three main lines:
## Coastal line:
- Actually two railway lines, one circumnavigating each island. The bridge serves as a connection point to and from the north and south.
	- Congested near **[[Barangay Tiwarik]]**//**[[Barangay Kannoyan]]** stations.
- Stations incorporate traditional wards and precolonial symbols in decorative murals.
- Night service operates under strict, and specific, protocols between **[[Barangay Sukab]]** and **[[Barangay Tiburon]]**.
- Maintennance crews often experience unusual equipment behavior near the **[[Geographic Features#Mount Oriol|Mount Oriol]]** station, which sometimes contributes to the aforementioned congestion. 
## University Line
- Primarily in **[[Barangay Lambat]]**, and the **[[Manmade Areas#San Magdalena University|San Magdalena University]]** to various residential districts.
- Makes use of some sections of the university's underground tunnels, and could theoretically connect to the coastal line.
- Certain stations remain semi-permanently closed since 1997, only being available during the island's various fiestas.
## Forest Line
- Special railway line connecting the **Cortez Corporation**'s various research facilities on the western half of the northern island.
- Operates exclusively from dawn to dusk. Passengers report signal interruptions when passing through the **[[Geographic Features#Kabigat Forest Reserve|Kabigat Forest Reserve]]**.
